This project is a creative twist on the traditional digital keyboard interface, designed to simulate a "mismatched" typing experience. In this web-based application, when the user presses a key on the keyboard, a different (wrong) letter appears on the screen—intentionally scrambled to create confusion and fun. The concept explores the idea of disorientation and correction in user interfaces.

The keyboard starts off in a "wrong" state, where each keystroke is mapped to an incorrect character. After entering a specific string (the "input"), the user is prompted with a message asking:
*"Do you want to make the keyboard right?"*

If the user selects *"Yes"*, the keyboard visually rotates to the right—symbolizing a literal and functional shift—and the key mappings are corrected. From that point onward, each key press outputs the correct letter, behaving like a standard keyboard.
