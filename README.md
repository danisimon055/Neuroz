Project Description

An elegant glass-style keyboard that types the wrong letters on purpose! Only when you ask nicely (press Enter), the keyboard politely asks if you want it fixed. Say "yes," and it rotates into a usable keyboard.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People are typing too fast and accurately. Where’s the fun in that?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We created a keyboard that deliberately outputs the *wrong letters* until you decide you’re ready to behave—and then, only then, it rotates and starts typing correctly.

### Diagrams

!\[Workflow]\(Add your workflow/architecture diagram here)
A user presses a key → Keyboard intercepts → Translates to wrong key (if not fixed) → Displays → Optionally corrects → UI rotates

## Project Demo

### Video

\[Add your demo video link here]
This video shows the wrong keyboard in action, how it responds to physical key presses, and the dramatic keyboard rotation when "Yes" is clicked.
